          <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
          <p>If you asked me three months ago if I could build a website I would have said no. Granted I had some ideas and could fake my way through it, but I didn't "know how" it all worked exactly. It was mostly copying and pasting other code (not that there is anything wrong with that at all).</p>

          <p>Fast forward to today and I would say, maybe. It's probably more like yes, but I like to under-promise and over-deliver. The point is I'm learning more and more each day. Pieces are clicking. I still only know a fraction and a very small fraction at that, but I have a base and I'm building on that.</p>

          <p>What was once a mountain staring up in front of me, is still a mountain, but I've taken a few steps. I can look back and see the progress I've made and that's super encouraging. There is also enough distance between my start and where I want to be to not turn back now. The main reason though is still I really want to see what's at the summit (this is the part where I'm supposed to say what lies at the top of the mountain is whatever you bring up there with you). But, that's not true in this case because before I had nothing and now I have things and I'm adding more each day. When I reach the top – and I will reach the top even if it takes a long time – I will have actually brought (ok learned) a lot on the way.</p>

          <p>I've also been blessed with a few wonderful Sherpas on the way. <a href="http://majman.com/" target="_blank">Marshall</a> has always been super helpful and I can't thank him enough for what he has taught me and more importantly how he supports me and believes in me. <a href="http://www.bartlewis.me/" target="_blank">Bart</a>, my co-founder is just the best. He fixes my many mistakes and tolerates my terrible HTML and CSS. He's also one of the nicest people I know. And <a href="http://falicon.com/" target="_blank">Kevin</a>, he seems almost too good to be true. Smart, friendly, helpful, and patient – the rare quadruple for a coder.</p>

          <p>What was once daunting is now less so. Thanks to a diet of daily grinding and dashes of well-timed and well-intentioned helpers along the way.
