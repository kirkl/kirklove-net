          <h2>People In Your Corner</h2>
          <p>What a great feeling having people who genuinely care supporting your efforts. It makes all the difference. Reading story after story about depressed and stressed entrepreneurs, some even tragically taking their own lives, I can't help but think they lost sight of that. In the end, their startup, and my feeble one as well, isn't what defines you. It ranks quite low on that totem pole.</p>

          <p>Mind you I'm pouring my heart and soul into this and very much believe it will be successful (who knows at what scale). Though I also already know its success or failure will not define me. I am much more than it. And there are things in my life much more important. Perhaps that wisdom comes with age and starting later is an advantage for me.</p>

          <p>Just remember, keep everything in perspective. Appreciate the ones who really care about you. Take time to say thank you for that support. Believe in yourself and work hard toward something you love. Though realize, you are so much more.</p>
