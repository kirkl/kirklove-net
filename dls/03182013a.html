          <h2>Progress (or lack thereof)</h2>
          <p>To keep me motivated I need to see progress. It doesn't have to be a lot, but there has to be some. It's my fuel.</p>

          <p>Let's take a specific example: I'm trying to get back into shape (yeah, yeah yeah aren't we all). I've been quite diligent in tracking what I eat. I'm working out again regularly. I've even built a small site (don't look for it, it's private) to track things. It has photos, weight, measurements, and comments. All devised to track progress.</p>

          <p>Well this week I made the wrong kind of progress. I gained a little weight. Despite what I thought were solid efforts to make progress in the "right" direction. It's amazing how much progress in either direction affects me. Positive progress makes me feel great, ready to push for more, and I feel super proud. Negative progress makes me feel like a failure and just want to throw in the towel as well as have a pint of Milkmade Ice Cream.</p>

          <p>It's hard to be honest about this. These tiny fluctuations shouldn't matter that much. But, to me they do. Though there is something really great about acknowledging your weaknesses. You take ownership of them instead of them owning you. Also, it gives you strength (or at least it does for me) to double your efforts and strive to make the right kind of progress the following week.</p>

          <p>I think that last point is the crucial one. It's easy when we're making strides to continue on. It's much tougher though far more critical to acknowledge things didn't go your way, but to keep trying and get back that positive feeling. To nip negativity in the bud. Face it, deal with it, then move on. Press forward and take control. Do that enough and you'll win (eventually). Tenacity trumps many things. Don't forget that and you'll make great progress over time.</p>
