          <h2>> 50</h2>
          <p>Sometimes the inflow of online data overwhelms me. It actually affects me physically. I don't like it. To combat that I've greatly reduced my interaction on social sites (and happen to be building one I think strikes the right balance). One tip I've found works really well for me is to significantly reduce the number of people I follow. To that avail I've put a hard cap on my following of less than 50 people per platform. Yes, no matter the social platform, I follow less than 50 people. It's tough, because I don't want to piss off anyone (silly really when you think about that) and two, a lot of people post great stuff, but I only have so much mental capacity. However, the pros have greatly outweighed the cons.</p>

          <p>The >50 limit has led to several serious improvements:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>There is a lot less "noise". A ton less actually.</li>
              <li>No mindlessly scrolling through stuff (again less noise)</li>
              <li>Check platforms far less (which I see as a good thing)</li>
              <li>Much greater appreciation for what I do see</li>
              <li>Formed stronger bonds with the people I do follow</li>
              <li>Don't miss what I don't see</li>
              <li>Reduces the need to "compete" or "compare"</li>
              <li>Frees me to have much stronger real-world interactions</li>
              <li>Calms my mind</li>
              <li>Forces me to re-evaluate who I am following and why</li>
            </ol>

          <p>Maybe this all sounds silly and I shouldn't worry about it. But, it works for me. Balance is important to me. I love the online social space (a lot). I just don't like that my addictive personalty can sometimes get consumed and overwhelmed by it. Hence the cap.</p>
