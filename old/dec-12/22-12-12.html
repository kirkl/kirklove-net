    <h3>Christmas 3 Days Early</h3>

    <p>Today is the Love family Christmas. We'll all gather in the same home we grew up in. It hasn't changed all that much and I love that. Now that we are all adults with our own families, my mom is wise enough to have the big family gathering the weekend BEFORE Christmas day. That way on Christmas day we can be in our own homes with our respective families. Smooth move mom.</p>

    <p>I really love this day a lot as I get to spend it with my brothers and sister and their spouses and children. I'm a big fan of family, especially mine. My one brother, Eric, lives in Austin, so he probably won't be there. Though I'm holding out hope for a Christmas' miracle and somehow he is. That would be the best present.</p>

    <p>It's also a great day to overeat. My mom puts out a sweet spread and I go to town. I'm usually full even before the main course as my mom always has tons and tons of shrimp cocktails ready (my fav at Christmas, and yes, she still spoils her baby even though he's 43!). I'm completely fine with that of course. It's going to be a great time and I'm really looking forward to it all.</p>

    <p>Merry Christmas everyone 3 days early!</p>
