    <h3>Getting Emotional</h3>

    <p>There is a vigorous debate happening on whether you should develop for Mobile-first or rather focus on Web-first. Vibhu Norby makes several stellar points in <a href="http://philosophically.com/why-were-pivoting-from-mobile-first-to-web-first" target="_blank">his post to abandon mobile</a> and focus on the desktop. And I firmly agree with him and is where I'm planting my flag. Fred Wilson countered with <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/12/rethinking-mobile-first.html" target="_blank">his take</a> (and he's written about this <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/09/mobile-first-web-second.html" target="_blank">a lot</a>) that mobile is the future and should be your primary focus. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Fred's opinion and guess what he's right as well. Though both are missing the main point in my mind – it's not about Web or Mobile (those are just channels) it's about whether your product or platform has an emotional connection with its audience.</p>

    <p>Simply put – platforms that connect on an emotional level will thrive, platforms that don't will die regardless of where they live.</p>

    <p>Let's look at the current crop of "winners". When you do, the channel plays a distant second to the emotional connection. Tumblr thrives because people love it and "feel" creative, not because it's on the desktop and mobile, but because it's easy to reblog cool shit. Twitter is ubiquitous not because of SMS, but rather because it gives a voice to the collective world. Facebook continues to grow because it still taps into the cool feeling of connecting with and old friend. Foursquare is winning the check-in wars because it's a vanity play for people to showoff where they are. Pinterest is skyrocketing because mid-western scrap-booking housewives have a place where they feel comfortable and welcomed. And Intstagram is exploding because everyone with a crappy cellphone camera are instantly able to take cool photos and in turn seem cool themselves. None of the users on these platforms gave a crap where they were developed, but they did give a crap about how the platform made them feel.</p>

    <p>Yes, the appropriate channel did play a role these examples (the ones mentioned above straddle both web and mobile). Though emotion played a bigger role and more importantly kept people coming back. You have to hit people on a gut level. Do that and you'll be fine. Don't and it won't matter one bit where you focus your development.</p>
