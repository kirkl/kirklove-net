    <h3>Today Was A Shitty Day</h3>

    <p>It sucks admitting that and I usually don't like to, but today was and I'm calling a spade a spade. There was no particular reason either, just a bunch of tiny little crappy things. The Bean woke up at 5 am in a cranky mood. That put Lili and I in cranky moods and it just went downhill from there. Cranky moods turned into shitty moods. The Bean decided it was a day for just crying and whimpering and Lili and I decided to take out our lack of patience on each other.</p>

    <p>It didn't help that it was cold and overcast. We also sat down to the do the budget (we do that on the 1st of the month). Planning and paying bills is never fun, especially this time of year when money is stretched a bit tighter. On top of that we had to run downtown for some errands and it was a zoo. It all added up to a craptastic kind of day.</p>

    <p>I get every day is a gift. Today was a gift I'd like to return. Here's to tomorrow.</p>
