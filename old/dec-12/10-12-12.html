    <h3>Complaining<br>About Nothing</h3>

    <p>Over the weekend I caught myself complaining. I really don't like when I do and try very hard not to it. Of course I still do and of course I complain about the most inconsequential things. These were actual things I complained about, out loud no less, this past weekend:</p>

    <p><ul class="no-color-reg-list">
        <li>It sucks having to get up to walk Reese in the rain</li>
        <li>Ugh, I hate having to walk a block for milk</li>
        <li>Man, I need a nap and Emma keeps bothering me</li>
        <li>My iPhone 4 is so slow</li>
        <li>We got the crappy seats at the end of Buvette's bar</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>I could go on with some even more trivial things I complained about, but I think you get the point. I'm not proud of it, that's for sure. Still, in the moment we don't realize how insanely trivial these complaints are (though trust me, they are). To shake myself out of it I put together a list in my head this morning while I was walking Reese. This is what real complaints would look like:</p>

    <p><ul class="no-color-reg-list">
        <li>I really don't want to have to go to chemo this morning</li>
        <li>I'm tired of being alone in this world</li>
        <li>It sucks I can't see or hear or walk or talk</li>
        <li>I wish I had a roof over my head and food to eat</li>
        <li>Why can't I have parents that love and support me</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>Again, I could go on here, too, though again I think you get the point. There are real complaints in the world and then there are the ones most of us fall victim to. The ones that in the end are completely insignificant and just make us look like sniveling little babies. I'm really going to strive to eliminate complaining entirely.</p>
