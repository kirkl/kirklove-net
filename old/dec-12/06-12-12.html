    <h3>Baby Steps</h3>

    <p>My kid is just taking her first steps. It's amazing to watch. She fumbles and stumbles and basically looks like a drunk old man. But, man is she determined. She knows â€“ if I just keep trying I'll get this.</p>

    <p>The other thing is she isn't going from a blob on the floor to strolling down the street overnight. It's been a rather long process that's taken around five months. And at only 14 months, that's over a third of her life. I think about that when I struggle with stuff and as I start my new journey. Everything takes time and repeated effort. Everything worth doing that is. If you're struggling with something, anything, don't forget that. Just keep at it. Soon you'll be cruising along, too.</p>
