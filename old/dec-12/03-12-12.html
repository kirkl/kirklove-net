    <h3>Making Scrambled Eggs</h3>

    <p>For over 40 years I thought I knew how to make scrambled eggs. I was wrong. Granted I could get a pile of eggs on a plate, but they tended to be clumpy, bland, and kind of pathetic.</p>

    <p>It became abundantly clear my scrambled egg-making was pretty dreadful when I had the eggs at <a href="http://perlanyc.com/#/home" target="_blank">Perla</a> and <a href="http://www.ilovebuvette.com/" target="_blank">Buvette</a>. These were great scrambled eggs! I wanted to make ones as good as them if not better. I talked to the chef at Perla, Michael Toscano, and he walked me through his steps – low heat, constantly stir, little butter, don't fuss with them too much, and don't overcook them. Solid advice and that led to a few good batches. But, I wanted more. I studied the eggs at Buvette. These are more simple than Perla. They are steamed and come with a lot of olive oil and grated pecorino romano. I liked that, too, but they still weren't perfect in my mind. And I wanted perfect eggs. Or I should say perfect for my taste.</p>

    <p>Then I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKWsOLR4wOE" target="_blank">this video on YouTube of Gordon Ramsey</a> showing you how to cook scrambled eggs. I loved the tip about the crème fraîche (sour cream works, too, in a pinch, but not as well) and chives. This was it. I found it. The technique and texture I wanted. So, I combined Gordon's technique, Perla's flavor profile, and Buvette's oil and pecorino romano as well as presentation into one perfect plate of scrambled eggs.</p>

    <p>The first couple of times making them, they were good, but not great. Though slowly I got better. I learned when to stop cooking them. How much salt and pepper to add, the right kind of bread to use, the right prosciutto, the proper amount of oil and cheese and on and on. It was a process that slowly came together. All of this might sound silly, but I love process and I love learning and I really love seeing those two things come together to create something I enjoy. So, yes this entire egg making post is really a metaphor (duh). Seek out what you enjoy. Study the people you think do it well. Practice, make mistakes, learn, iterate, and tweak to your preference. In the end you'll have something pretty wonderful, a new skill set you feel confident in and in this case something quite delicious, too.</p>
