    <h3>Happy Birthday To Me</h3>

     <div class="caption-at-top">A Carvel ice cream cake. The best birthday cake ever.</div>

    <p>Today is my 43rd birthday. I kind of can't believe I'm 43. Mostly because I still act like a giant kid. Sure, each year I look a little older , but inside there is still this energetic child bursting to get out. I like that I'm that way. I still play video games and get positively giddy over the latest gadgets. Even now I want an ice cream cake for my birthday! I hope that never changes. I have no desire to "grow up" and "start acting like a serious adult". How incredibly boring.</p>

    <p>Plus, I think we can learn a lot from acting like a kid. Mind you I'm not saying it's ok to behave immaturely. But, it's super OK to strive to have fun. To laugh. To be inquisitive. To learn. To grow. To fail and shrug it off. To do all the wonderful things kids do.</p>

    <p>Having a 14-month-old daughter is a great way to remind me of that as well. She's the best. I'm so thankful I get to share this day with her and my amazing wife. As a special bonus my brother, Mark, stayed with us last night since he was in town for business. My family is the greatest gift I could ever receive by far. I honestly don't need anything else.</p>

    <p>Happy 43rd to me. I'm grateful for every single day I get on this planet.</p>

    <p>Ok, now off to play.</p>
