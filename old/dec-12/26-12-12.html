    <h3>Just Ducky</h3>

    <p>Yesterday Paraguay and I cooked Christmas dinner. It was a huge success. We decided to go with pan-seared duck breast, scalloped potatoes au gratin, and brussell sprouts. Lili handled the sides and I tackled the duck.</p>

    <p>Her sides were awesome, especially the potatoes au gratin. She used a gruyere cheese that really set them off. The brussel sprouts were nice, charred well, but we both agreed lacked a kick of flavor. We need to tweak our recipe for them. Not sure exactly how though, maybe add a touch of vinegar and pecorino romano.</p>

    <p>The duck meat was ordered from Fresh Direct and it was super, top-notch quality. It should be though as it was not cheap at $26 for just under 2 lbs. I was petrified I was going to ruin and overcook that wonderful piece of meat, but I have to say it came out perfect. Simple cross hatch cuts to open up the fan, pan-fry on medium heat for 12-mins fat side (then drain the duck fat) then 8 mins on the flip side. Two keys: Don't mess with it, just leave it there in the pan. And two, let it rest properly before slicing it. Comes out perfectly medium rare and juicy. The sauce we made was a cherry, wine, and apple reudction. It was good, but way too much work for way too little of an add to the dish. Plus, the mallard duck breast was so meaty and delicious it didn't really need anything on top of it other than a bit of salt and pepper. It really tasted more like a fine steak. I say save the two cups of red wine needed for the sauce and drink them in a glass instead.</p>

    <p>As for wine, we went with a Lancaster Curvee 2008. Man, <a href="http://lancaster-estate.com/" target="_blank">Lancaster</a> makes amazing wines. Can't say enough good things about them.</p>

    <p>All in all an amazing Christmas meal. Our criteria for home-cooking is would we be happy paying $25 for the dish at a restaurant. If we say, "Yes" then we figure we did a pretty good job. This one was a "Hell yes!". I'm pretty proud we pulled it off. It was wonderful. Even better there are leftovers for lunch today!</p>
