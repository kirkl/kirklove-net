    <h3>The Creative Habit</h3>

    <p>Currently I'm re-reading Twyla Tharp's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Creative-Habit-Learn-Life/dp/0743235274/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank"><em>The Creative Habit</em></a>. It's a well written book with great advice on developing routines to maximize creativity. This time through I'm isolating key takeaways and actionable items. I hate to admit it, while I'm a pretty good "big picture" guy, I'm not so stellar at details and follow-through. At least I know that and I'm working on getting stronger in those areas. One way to do that is routine and Twyla lays out some great steps on how to apply yourself every day. One word of caution if you decide to read the book - brace yourself - Twyla is <em>very</em> impressed with herself and is not afraid to tell people. At times it's tough to take. Shake that off and follow the advice, it's rock-solid and works.</p>

    <p>One super helpful exercise is filling out what she calls a Creative Autobiography. It's 33 questions that help you frame moments in your life that you thought you were creative, as well as your motivations, strengths, and weaknesses. It's important to be honest. Taking this critical look at yourself is super helpful.</p>

    <p>For 2013 I'm really striving for more calm and routine in my life. This book was a good way to get me started down that path. I recommend checking it out.</p>
