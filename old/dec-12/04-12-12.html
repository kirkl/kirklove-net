    <h3>Tiny Victories</h3>

    <p><em><strong>&#8220;Success begets success&#8221;</strong></em></p>

    <p>Yesterday I was a struggling a bit with a basic local server set up on a MacBook Air. Ever since Apple removed Web Sharing in Mountain Lion, you have to hack under the hood a bit in Terminal to bring it back. Again, this is super pedestrian stuff for any coder or sys admin, but it's virgin territory for me.</p>

    <p>Of course along the way, somewhere in Terminal I keyed in something wrong and botched the entire works. My user profile went poof.</p>

    <p>Almost instantly that feeling of being in over your head kicked in. From there it escalated into full self doubt. At one point I even said out loud to myself, "I'm so dumb, I can't do this, and this is nothing!"</p>

    <p>Then after my small pity party I stepped away for a bit, cooled down, and came back. I was determined to get this to work even if it took me the entire afternoon. I trashed my user profile and started again. I hunted down a few more tutorials on how to do it. Copied out the code. Modified it for me. Double-checked it. Fired up Terminal and readied myself for take 2. Then taking a big gulp starting keying in the info. This time â€“ success.</p>

    <p>I still have no idea what I did wrong the first time, but it doesn't matter really. In the end I got it right and it's working. As I sat alone in my room pumping my fist in the air and saying, "Fuck yeah I did it!" I probably looked kind of insane. So what. That positive energy was awesome. Now I'm ready for the next challenge. There will be many, and many more failures. Right now though, I'm delighting in my tiny victory.</p>
