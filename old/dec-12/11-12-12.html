    <h3>Checking Out<br>Of Foursquare</h3>

    <p>In the last few months I found myself using <a href="https://foursquare.com/kirklove" target="_blank">Foursquare</a> heavily. In a way it became a mini-blogging platform for me. Makes sense as I stopped using Tumblr for posts other than audio.</p>

    <p>Lately though I haven't been enjoying the Foursquare experience much. By no means is it Foursquare's fault. In fact, what Dennis and team have built is an amazing platform and they should get a ton of credit. But, for me something was off. Mainly I found myself jealous of other people on Foursqaure. Saying things like, "Oh man I want to be where so and so is at." I didn't like that feeling. Also, I found Foursquare thwarted, not aided, my desire for serendipity. I didn't like that either. Also, in New York City it served little purpose for me. Again, I completely realize these are my personal hang-ups and nothing to do with Foursquare.</p>

    <p>Still, one thing I will say (rather assuredly) is Foursquare as much as it wants to position itself as a recommendation engine is really for all intensive purposes a vanity play. People broadcast their whereabouts to let others know how cool they are. That's the main reason, if not sole reason, the vast amount of Foursquare users check-in. That's fine. It's why I was using it most times if I'm being honest. And that's what bothered me. So that's why I'm checking out. Probably not completely. I'll still use it for Lists (which are great) and for special places that I want to remember and could care less if people think are cool or not.</p>

    <p>See you out in the wild.</p>
