    <h3>A Day With The<br> Coolest Kid On Earth</h3>

    <p>Yesterday I spent the entire day with The Bean. It was great. We woke up and took a long walk with Reese and Paraguay in Central Park. Then we had a great breakfast together. Once she woke up from her morning nap, just her and I went to lunch at Perla. We had a blast and a wicked awesome cheeseburger, too. From there we strolled around downtown for a bit and swung up to my oldest friend's (since we were 4!) apartment on 18th and Broadway. It was fun just hanging there. Bean's become quite the entertainer and he was getting a kick out of her.</p>

    <p>By the time we got home from all that it was time to walk Reese again so we cruised uptown through Central Park to Irving coffee on 79th. The Bean was such a trooper, hanging with me for the bulk of the day. She did nod off for a quick nap around 3:00 PM. But, for the most part she was with me, step for step. We covered a lot ground, and trust me, this kid does not like to miss a thing.</p>

    <p>Coming back she passed out almost exactly as we got to the door of the apartment as if to say, ok I'm home, enough Papi. Mom was home by then, too (she spent the day shopping) and she brushed her teeth, changed her and put her to bed. The Bean was out in two seconds flat. She had a pretty full day with her dad. I loved every minute of it. I think she did, too. The Bean really is the best.</p>
