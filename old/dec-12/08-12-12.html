    <h3>To Perla With My Baby</h3>

    <p>Last night my beautiful wife and I went to Perla for my "official" birthday dinner. Granted my birthday isn't until the 13th, but last night worked out well with a sitter for The Bean.</p>

    <p>We had tried to make a reservation earlier in the week. We don't have a secret number to call or email so we struck out getting a specific time unless we wanted to eat at 5:15 (no thanks). We decided to just roll the dice and show up at 7 pm. If we had to wait, so what. Well, the place was mobbed. That makes me one-half thrilled as I want it to stay around forever, but it also makes me nervous, because it's harder and harder to get a table. Luckily it helps we've been there a ton and pretty much everyone recognizes us so Amy (the hostess) was kind enough to grab us and pull us through the large crowd and plunk us down instantly at two prime bar spots. Jackpot! That felt really good. Like we were special. It was probably just lucky timing, but either way I'll take it. I also really loving eating at the bar even more so than a table.</p>

    <p>The food is always stellar at Perla and last night was no exception. I'll get to the food in a second, but the highlight for me is the staff there. They are just absolute great people. A lot of them came up to say high and ask how we were and how The Bean was doing. That means a ton. Last night we were waited on by a new (to us) bartender named Ken. He was absolutely fantastic and really made the night great. I really can't say enough wonderful things about how every single member of that crew treats people. Not just us, but again every body that comes in there. Nice to see in a town like NYC.</p>

    <p>OK... enough right... how was the food...</p>

    <p>The food was amazing. Really amazing. I always say I want to go to so many places in New  York (and I do), but I am always so happy to go back to Perla. It's just so perfect for me. Here's a rundown of what we had – and boy did we have a lot:</p>

    <ul class="reg-list">
        <p><strong>APPETIZERS:</strong></p>
        <li>We ordered the arugula and cauliflower salad. This dish is so simple, yet wonderful. It has anchovies and pancetta, too. So good.</li>
        <li>We also ordered the San Danielle prosciutto. I really like it here as it isn't too salty. Just the right touch.</li>
        <li>The have new bread now. A house-made focaccia. It's OK. I like the old Sullivan St Bread they used to have a lot better.</li>
        <li>They brought out a few extra appetizers for us as well: The potato chips alla triciana. Super good last night since they were crisp and a little burnt.</li>
        <li>Foie Gras macaroons. Yeah, that's right, foie gras macaroons! These babies aren't on the menu so we got lucky. The whiny annoying guy next to us complained he didn't get any (ha). I ended up giving him one to half shut him up and half show him up. Probably mean of me, but oh well. He was a putz. Anyway these were really good.</li>
        <li>Scallop crudo with grapefruit and yogurt. I was going to order this but passed, so I was really happy they gave it to us. Super good. Light, fresh, and really well done.</li>
        <br>
        <p><strong>PASTAS:</strong></p>
        <li>We went with the special pasta of the night which was a dry pasta with rock shrimp, calamari, and basil. This is really similar to their best dish in my opinion – spaghetti with rock shrimp. Though that's not on the menu right now (just in the summer). I'm happy to say this dish is very, very close to that. Definitely more "dense" from the dry pasta, but it all works. The calamari adds a lot of substance, too.</li>
        <li>Lili chose the tajarin with truffles. Holy smokes was that good. It's intense and I don't think one person can eat an entire plate, the flavor is probably too powerful. It's perfect for sharing though. This won't be on the menu forever so if you go, get it. It's a real treat. (FYI: They have white truffles right now as a supplement, but I always thought that was retarded to pay $80 for a shaving of it, so we obviously passed).</li>
        <br>
        <p><strong>ENTREES:</strong></p>
        <li>We were getting pretty full at this point, but still had an entree to share (at least we were smart enough to order only one). This was a tough choice. We almost went with the lamb shank special or the rib-eye special, but we ended up going with the braised beef rib. Super glad we did. It was amazing. It cut with a fork and melted in your mouth. Even full I polished this off.</li>
         <br>
        <p><strong>DESSERTS:</strong></p>
        <li>We had the praline crunch. Really top notch. Dessert is one area Perla has really started to get better at and this one was probably the best I've ever had there.</li>
        <li>They gave us a few after dinner drinks, too. A muscat blend that was really good. Don't remember the name.</li>
        <li>Oh yeah, that reminds me - we drank a lot, too, ha! We even did some tequila shots pre-pasta course. What the heck, it was my birthday!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Really I couldn't have asked for a better night. I've been to Perla a ton now, with a lot of great people along the way, though nothing tops sitting at the bar alone with my baby. I wouldn't trade it for the world and it was definitely the perfect birthday present. Gracias mi vida. Te quiero.</p>
