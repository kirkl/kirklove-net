    <h3>Calling It Like I See It</h3>

    <p>The other day I was having breakfast with a friend. This person happens to be rather well-known in certain circles and has been very successful for himself. As such he's surrounded by a lot of nauseating, ass-kissers. I don't envy that one bit.</p>

    <p>He asked me for my thoughts on something he was involved in and I told him my honest opinion, which wasn't all that favorable. He seemed surprised and grateful at the same time saying, "Most people don't level with me like that." My first reaction was I feel sorry for <i>those</i> people and my second was, "I call it like I see it and I don't give a crap who you are." I didn't mean that as disrespectful. Quite the contrary, I'm incredibly impressed by this individual and all he's accomplished. He's a great dude and I like him a lot. I'm also keenly aware that he wakes up and puts his pants on one leg at a time, just like me (though to be fair, he could easily pay someone to put his pants on for him, ha).</p>

    <p>The point is, I've never been one to be impressed by anyone's title, wealth, or status. And, if you ask me for my opinion I'm going to give it to you â€“ unfiltered and unflinching. So, don't ask if you don't want to hear it. Though, if you want a solid, honest, sounding board bereft of bullshit then I'm your guy.</p>
