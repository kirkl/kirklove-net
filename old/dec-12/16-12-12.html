    <h3>Reflecting</h3>

    <p>Saturday and Sunday mornings Reese, Bean and I head out for long walks in Central Park. On Saturdays we head south and east toward The Pond (pictured above). It's a beautiful, little oasis just steps off 5th ave and Central Park West. On Sundays we head north and go through The Ramble and visit Bow Bridge and of course stop and say hi to Wil, the Weeping Willow. I really enjoy these walks. Growing up we used to go to church every Sunday. I never really loved it, but I did love what my father used to say to me, "It's OK if you don't like, but it's good to take an hour a week to stop, calm your mind, reflect, and think." That advice has stuck with me. Except now the woods of Central Park are my church.</p>

    <p>These walks are my "free" time. No phones, no computers, no distractions. It's meditation for me and I do some of my best thinking during them. I often reflect on my life â€“ what I'm grateful for, remembering old friends and loved ones who have passed, feeling one with mother nature, thinking about what I want to improve in myself (typically it's letting go, more patience, and relinquishing control). These walks really help and are the best shrinks money can't buy.</p>

    <p>Related I often "design in mind" as I call it on these walks. If I'm working on some design, or feature, or problem I'm able to lay out all the pieces in my mind during the walk then come back to my computer, sit down and bang it out. I love that.</p>

    <p>Mostly I love the routine. I'm a big fan of routines and finally getting back into one after a shaky year with the apartment renovation and newborn kid.</p>

    <p>I highly recommend finding time to "reflect". For me it's a godsend.</p>
