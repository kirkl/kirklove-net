        <h3>My Own Little World</h3>

        <div class="caption-at-top">
        "When you make a business, you’re making a little world where you control the laws. It doesn’t matter how things are done everywhere else. In your little world, you can make it like it should be."
        <br>
        <br>
        – Derek Sivers
        </div>

        <p>Over a year ago I bookmarked this quote from Derek Sivers. Every few weeks I'd go back and read it – a little world where you control the laws. It fascinated me and called to me. It would repeat, "Do it." Problem was I didn't know what kind of "world" I wanted to build. Then about six months ago I figured it out. At least in my head. And thus began the inevitability of today.</p>

        <p>Today is my last day at <a href="http://ex.fm/" target="_blank">ex.fm</a>.</p>

        <p>I suppose I could have taken the "safer" route and worked on my idea on nights and weekends. But, I didn't think that was fair to exfm as my heart and mind were being pulled toward "my little world". It also wasn't fair to me or my family.</p>

        <p>I'm leaving exfm on the best of terms. I truly love the platform and believe 100% it's the absolute best way to discover music online. I'm incredibly grateful to have worked with a fantastic team. Dan, Marshall, and crew are doing a killer job. I will miss them, but they will move forward just fine. And I will move forward as well. (As my friend Maura likes to say, "Keep moving".)</p>

        <p>All of this is incredibly exciting, liberating, scary, and unknown. I like ALL that. Details to follow. For now I'm off to Paraguay for a bit then full-speed ahead.</p>

        <p>If you want a sneak peak or have questions feel free to write. I also want to take a minute and thank my amazing wife for believing in me and agreeing to take this chance alongside me. It's humbling. Sos la mejor mi vida. I also hope I can count on the support of my friends. I'll need that, too. Ok then, onward!</p>
