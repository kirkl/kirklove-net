        <h3>Invest Your Heart</h3>

        <div class="caption-at-top">
        "One reason to do something is because you get paid to do it. But it’s sad to think that this might be the only reason to do something. Now that you’ve got a skillset and trust and leverage and a following and the tools to make something happen, are you going to invest your heart and soul into something that’s important?"
        <br>
        <br>
        – Seth Godin
        </div>

        <p>Seth is a dangerous man. He puts a lot of crazy ideas into people's heads. He certainly has put a lot in mine and I'm indebted to him for that. The quote above is one that really struck me. And it follows on the heels of yesterday's post about why I'm starting my own company, or "my own little world".</p>

        <p>Money has never been that important to me. Being happy has. Creating things has. Having autonomy and making decisions has. Building something you want to see in the world has as well.</p>

        <p>Make no mistake there is a degree of arrogance here as well. I want to be the man. If I fall on my face well, dammit, I fell because of the choices I made. I've got no problem with that. This blog right here is small piece of my idea – albeit not really my idea at all. It's more the kernel or seed or mindset. Good stuff is coming I can promise you that. At least good stuff to me. And with that enough talking about it. It's time to invest my heart and soul into something that's super important to me. It's time to build it.</p>
