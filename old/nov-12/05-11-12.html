        <h3>Mighty Tree &amp; Wil</h3>

        <p>I talk to trees.</p>

        <p>More accurately, I talk specific trees. Yes, I realize, that sounds crazy. But, I do. And I enjoy it and it helps me a lot. For starters, trees are amazing listeners. You never have to worry about getting interrupted. They just stand there, stoic, listening. And they can listen as long as you can talk.<span class="super"><a href="#footer1">*</a></span></p>

        <p>When I lived in Palmyra, NJ, Reese (my dog) and I used to go hiking at <a href="http://www.taylorwildlifepreserve.org/index.html" target="_blank">Taylor's Wildlife Preserve</a>. Deep inside, down a long, seldom visited path, right on the banks of the Delaware river was a tree I visited often. I called her "Mighty Tree". She was old, grand, battered, scarred, and just beautiful. We had a lot of great conversations. I used to imagine all the things she had seen in her 100+ years of life. The wisdom stored in her roots, trunk, branches, and limbs. What she endured over the years in that harsh spot on the banks. She listened to me a lot and I thank her for that. I miss her.</p>

        <p>Now I talk to another tree. A beautiful old White Weeping Willow in Central Park. I've called him Wil. It fits. He's beautiful as well and sits in the most pristine spot in all of Central Park. He's nestled in this little patch of land all to his own at the base of Bow Bridge. He gets to look out onto The Lake and one of, if not the most beautiful vistas I've ever scene. He's old and wise and has seen and heard every story in the book. Countless lovers have passed him bye. Mostly I tell him how good he looks today, and he shutters a little bit, rustling his leaves a tad in embarrassment (though he secretly likes it). I tell him what I'm thinking, what I'm scared of, and I ask him what I should do about certain things. He the best shrink in the world and you can't beat the price. I'm really grateful he's there.</p>

        <p>All of this might sound silly, but it's not to me. Nature has long been a calming force. It certainly is for me. I've stated many times I couldn't live in New York City without being close to the park. Wil is a big reason why.</p>

        <div class="caption"><span class="super">*</span> My fascination and love of trees certainly stems from my love of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Giving-Tree-Shel-Silverstein/dp/0060256656" target="_blank">The Giving Tree</a> by Shel Silverstein. It's my favorite book of all time.</div>
