    <h3>Alone In Central Park</h3>

    <p>The cold bite is already in the air in the morning and winter will soon be here. Then Central Park will be mine again. While most flee it during the harsh months I relish in it. That's not to say I don't love the summer bustle of Central Park, I most certainly do, but my preference is the quiet, dead, winter months. Mostly because I've come to love being alone.</p>

    <p>I wasn't always that way. I used to be the opposite, actually. I'd host parties, seek out crowded spaces, crave to be the center of attention. Though that's changed. I suppose it's because of some life events and just because I'm getting older. Still, nowadays, I prefer solitude.</p>

    <p>For me there is a profound sense of peace and calm in being alone. A tranquility that I can't experience any way else. I'm very comfortable being alone. In fact I like how "small" it makes me feel in the world. And when I feel small, my problems feel even smaller to the point where they virtually melt away.</p>

    <p>Being alone in Central Park just amplifies that wonderful calming effect. In a city that is 24/7 noise and chaos, that calm is most welcomed, especially for me.</p>
