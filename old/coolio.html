        <h3>Bitching</h3>

        <p>Yesterday I wrote about a great loss in my life. A loss an unceremonious select few experience. That kind of loss gives you perspective and makes you super appreciative of what you have. I could pretend I always had that positive spin on things, but that would be a lie. It's taken me years to regain a positive attitude and during that time I was known to bitch a lot. Let's just say I had my fair share of pity parties, too. There are still days when the "bitcher" in me wins, but I'm happy to say they are less and less.</p>

        <p>What I've learned is bitching gets you nothing except more upset. Plus, no one cares you are bitching. You are just hurting yourself.</p>

        <p>Instead what I do now is focus on the following list. I repeat them like a mantra:</p>

            <ul class="reg-list">
                <li>Focus on what I have, not what I don't</li>
                <li>Eschew materialistic things</li>
                <li>Don't try to control others, accept them</li>
                <li>Let things go</li>
                <li>Choose to be happy</li>
                <li>Put others ahead of yourself</p>
            </ul>

        <p>The remarkable thing is this really works. It seems like mumbo-jumbo, but it's not. If you find yourself in a bitchy mood take five minutes to reflect on why, then run down this list and really try to apply them. I guarantee you'll stop bitching and you'll feel a ton better.</p>
