        <h3>Commit</h3>

        <p>Last night with Lili out and Bean asleep I sat down at the computer for a rare stretch of uninterrupted work time. After a few minutes (sad I know) I checked Twitter (my first mistake) and noticed the #debates tag. I flicked on the TV for a little background noise (second mistake). Instead I found myself bouncing back and forth from the computer to the TV, trying to do two things at once and doing neither well. Moreover, I started chiming back and forth with some friends on Twitter, IM, and SMS on my cell (my third and final strike toward a productive evening). My mind was now officially being pulled in five different directions by three different devices.</p>

        <p>That's the problem with all this noise â€“ we've been duped into thinking it adds to the experience. In reality all it does is distract. It literally splits our attention into bite-size chunks of data junk food. As a result nothing is truly satisfying.</p>

        <p>What I should have done is just worked. That was my goal. Or I should have at least stopped working and watched the debates and actually listened and engaged my mind if that was more important. Neither happened. Another ugly side effect was I felt guilty for not doing what I was supposed to do in the first place.</p>

        <p>I'm doing well in other areas of my life of reducing, focusing, and letting go (all important), but for some reason last night's scenario still happens all too often. It fragments my mind and I don't like it. I need to commit to one thing and do it. I'll be better for it and the output will be as well.</p>
