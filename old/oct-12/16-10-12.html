        <h3>The Stats So Far</h3>

        <div class="large-image-container">

        </div>

        <p>At first I wasn't sure if I wanted any type of tracking with this new blog experiment. Then at the last minute I added Google Analytics. I'm still not sure I'll keep it. That said, it's been interesting to look at the numbers.</p>

        <p>Make no mistake the numbers are small. Minuscule in fact. Though you can look at that two ways, positive or negative. Let's tackle negative first: I've lost a lot of eyeballs. Going from a Tumblr blog where I had over 3,000 followers (#FollowersBrag) to a self-hosted site that's expected. Though that 3,000+ number was always misleading and has been stagnant for over a year. Minus the bots, porn blogs, and 14-year-old Malaysian girls who follow me for some reason, that number is really closer to a few hundred "followers" if that. And then of that subset fewer still actively read what I post. I would put that number (based on Loves) around a few dozen.</p>

        <p>Taking all that into account the metrics on the new blog home actually jive. And here's the important part (to me) â€“ people are coming to my page to focus on my post and only my post. It's only a minute or two, but it's a conscious effort, not merely scrolling through an endless dashboard. That's the part that interests me most. That singular focus. I have a few sites I visit directly as well, because I care about those people. I think the converse is true for me and I'm flattered and honored as a result.</p>

        <p>I remember a while back <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> talked about starting Wine Library TV and how much he loved those first few users. He cherished them and that made a big difference. I believe in that. I believe it's far more important to have real, engaging relationships with people (online and off) than amassing huge follower counts. Will be fun to see where this goes. And to the people<span class="super">*</span> who visit each day - thanks.</p>

        <div class="caption"><span class="super">*</span>I would like to figure out a better way to determine who exactly those people are so we can foster stronger relationships. Need to think on that. Thanks again to you and if you're reading this in the meantime feel free to email me. I'd like that.
