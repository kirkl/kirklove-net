    <h3>Una Fiesta Hoy</h3>

    <p>My daughter turned one this past Monday. She had a little playdate group, kids party that day. I had to miss it because of work, but the wife took a lot of great photos. Today, however, is the big "Family &amp; Friends" shin dig. I'm really excited. I'm not a big party person any more and especially don't like them when they are for me. But I'm stoked for this. We've got an ice cream cake from Cones down on Bleecker street coming and a lot of tasty empanadas and South American pastries from La Nueva in Jackson Heights. It should all make for a great time.</p>

    <p>It's been really fun watching the wife teach The Bean how to clap along to the Happy Birthday song (in Spanish and English). Bean's actually got it down pretty well. We'll see if she comes through when the spotlight is on and it's for real or she freezes up, ha. I've got faith. Now as for the blowing out the candle part, she's struggling a bit with that. She kind of puckers her lips and just makes a buzzing sound. It's pretty damn cute though.</p>

    <p>Looking forward to spending the day with family and friends. The people who truly matter to me and hopefully one day truly matter to Emma.</p>
