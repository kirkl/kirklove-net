    <h3>Stop. Drop. And Roll.</h3>

    <p>This may come as a shock to my wife, but I'll admit I'm not perfect.</p>

    <p>Jokes aside I have faults. Many faults. Though I'm working on them and genuinely trying to be a happy, appreciative, kind, patient person. I don't always succeed at that.</p>

    <p>One of my biggest, most-noticeable flaws is a two-headed beast of overreaction and lingering regret. Often I react impulsively, and sadly, poorly when faced with situations where I either feel frightened or attacked. I don't like it. I'm even conscious of the fact I'm doing it and still can't help myself. I'm human. I'm going to react poorly at times. I get that and I know I will get better if I focus on it. Though beating myself up afterward, sometimes for days or weeks is where I'm really bad.</p>

    <p>Let me give you an example: I bumped into someone a little while back. Someone I considered a friend though he had decided for whatever reason to cut ties (still not sure why though mostly because he's very awkward socially). Still, it bothered me and seeing him again brought up a bunch of shit. He was nervous seeing me again, you could tell,  and offered up a weak, "Let's grab dinner, soon, I'll write you." He hasn't written and he won't. I knew that as soon as he said it. It was a lie and an easy out for him. He went on his way and most likely forgot about the exchange a few moments later. But, not me. I thought about it a while. I beat myself up over it. I thought what could have I done differently. The truth of the matter is there is nothing I could or should have done. It's his issue not mine. Though I shoulder the blame. I need to learn to let that go.</p>

    <p>There are more examples of this. Me getting noticeable upset if someone says something rude about Reese in the park. Or getting mad that another set of friends never accept our dinner invitation. Or feeling anxious over a decision that has come and gone and there is nothing I can do about it anymore. And yet I replay the scenario in my mind over and over and over analyzing it.</p>

    <p>Thankfully I'm aware I'm doing it and that's half the battle. Also, I have an amazing supportive wife who is helping me to just let stuff go. It's not in my nature, but I'm getting better. It's also why I titled this post a play off the classic fire safety tip, "Stop. Drop. And Roll." While in the moment I'm consciously telling myself – Stop, don't overreact. Drop, put your defenses down. Roll – let it go, move on and go with the flow of life. It's helping, though I've got a ways to go.</p>
