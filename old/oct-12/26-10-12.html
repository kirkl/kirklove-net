        <h3>Letterpress: A New Game From Loren Brichter</h3>

        <p>I've got an <strike>thing</strike> obsession for puzzle games. I love <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drop7-free-by-zynga/id425242132?mt=8" target="_blank">Drop7</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/puzzlejuice/id457273926?mt=8" target="_blank">PuzzleJuice</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-word-warp/id291374609?mt=8" target="_blank">Word Warp</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spelltower/id476500832?mt=8" target="_blank">SpellTower</a>. I'm also a big fan of <a href="https://twitter.com/lorenb" target="_blank">Loren Brichter</a> who almost single-handely re-invented UI conventions for the iPhone with his Twitter app Tweetie (which was so ahead of Twitter's own they bought it and him). But, he left Twitter to start a gaming company (Yay!) and his first game is called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8" target="_blank">Letterpress</a> – a puzzle game (Double Yay!). I jumped on it and I'm in love.</p>

        <p>I'll admit I didn't "get" it at first. Probably still don't know the best strategies for sure, but it doesn't matter, I'm addicted. It's that perfect mix of Loren – simple and obvious on the surface, but deep and nuisanced at the same time. There is a bit of luck and a bit of strategy. Having a good vocabulary helps a lot, too. The easiest way to describe it is WordFind meets Boogle meets Go (aka Othello).</p>

        <p>The UI is clean and beautiful (though I don't care for any of the color themes besides the default Light one). Playing multiple games at a time is a snap (requires the $0.99 upgrade) and is actually quite a joy to trigger the animation. The only drawback (and it's a big one) is it's Apple Game Center play only. And Apple Game Center blows. Often I can't get connected to an opponent or turns don't update or I can't submit a word and that really sucks the life out of the game, so be warned. It's not Loren's fault and I commend him for tyring this, though I suspect it was also done to avoid having to build a computer AI. My wife and I played a a few games last night (she loves puzzle games, too) and it would be ideal for us if they had a simple wireless ad-hoc network option to play head-to-head on the same Wifi. Hopefully that will come later (pretty please Loren).</p>

        <p>In any event you should definitely check out <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8" target="_blank">Letterpress</a>. If you do and you want to play a game, my Apple Game Center ID is kirklove1. Puzzle on!
