        <h3>Hire great writers</h3>

        <p>Jason Fried, co-founder of <a href="http://37signals.com">37Signals</a> is someone I admire. The three words in the healine above are his best advice ever. I keep a scan (<a href="#pictured">pictured below</a>) of the page from <a href="http://37signals.com/rework">ReWork</a> that explains the thinking behind "Hire great writers". It's no coincidence it's written wonderfully. The last line is particularly perfct: Writing is today's currency for good ideas.</p>

        <p>What a powerful line. As I file though my mind the people I admire most are all great writers and communicators.</p>

        <p>As for my own writing, I'm decent. Maybe even above average. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd be a solid six. On some days I may even be a seven. My goal is to be a consistent nine. I've got work to do.</p>

        <p>The good news is anyone can get better at writing. The steps aren't a secret:</p>

            <ul class="reg-list">
                <li>Read other great writing and learn from it.</li>
                <li>Develop a voice. Be yourself. And be genuine.</li>
                <li>Write a lot and often. You'll get better.</li>
                <li>Avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge"><em>"Curse of Knowledge"</em></a>. No one is inside your head.</li>
                <li>Edit. Then edit again. Then go back and edit yet again.</li>
                <li>Get outside feedback when possible.</li>
                <li>Ruthlessly trim (like editing, but harsher). Less is Less.</li>
                <li>Repeat all these items over and over.</li>
            </ul>

        The Bean's Official Birthday Party was this past Saturday.
        I love the photo of her and Paraguay up top. It makes my heart smile. It was also the first time Bean ate ice cream. Suffice it to say she enjoyed it quite a bit.
