        <h3>A New Experiment.</h3>

         <p>Overwhelmed by endless Feeds online I'm trying something new with this blog. It will only contain one post at a time. When updated the old post will be deleted and won't be archived. There will also be no tags, follower counts, comments, analytics, or even Likes. Overall, it's insanely simple. Even the design.</p>

         <p>This new format is most definitely an experiment and it may even change over time. Though it's something I've been mulling around in my head for awhile. Something incredibly simple, utilitarian, and focused. I think it accomplishes all that. I hope you continue to visit and check it out. Feel free to drop me a line and let me know what you think. Best.</p>
