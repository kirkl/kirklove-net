        <h3>Apple Doesn&#8217;t Innovate<br>They Iterate</h3>

        <p>Apple gets a lot of credit for being an innovative company. That was true five years ago when they rolled out the iPhone. And also true when it comes to the iPad and even MacBook Airs (though the Airs took a few tries to get it right) . Now, Apple doesn't innovate much if at all. That's not a knock, it's merely a misnomer for the capital-flush tech behemoth. Now, Apple iterates. Year after year, they turn out small, yet meaningful improvements to their products. It's impressive to watch.</p>

        <p>Along the way they've become masters of supply chain management. Their strengths lying much more in machining and manufacturing than design or actually inventing anything new. Again, that's OK.</p>

        <div class="large-image-container-550">
            <img src="images/ipadmini.jpg" alt="ipad mini photo"/>
        </div>

        <p>Remarkably I find myself coveting the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/overview/" target="_blank">iPad mini</a> (pictured) along with the the new 13-inch <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" target="_blank">MacBook Pro Retina</a>, the new, gorgeous <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/" target="_blank">iMac</a>, and of course the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone 5</a>. Mind you, I need NONE of them. I already have an original iPad and iPad 3, a fully functioning MacPro tower, a 21-inch Mac Monitor, a MacBook Air, and an iPhone 4 (my wife also has an iPhone 4 and an 11-inch MacBook Air).Yet I want these latest gadgets even though it's nothing new. It's just the next iteration.</p>

        <p>Mind you, soon Apple will be forced to innovate again if it wants to stay on top. For now (and probably for the next several years or even decade) they'll do just fine racking in obscene profits just iterating. Good for them they deserve it.</p>
