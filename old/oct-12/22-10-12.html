        <h3>Routine</h3>

        <p>Too often "routine" is seen as an albatross. Something that restricts. I fall in the opposite camp. Without a routine I find I slip into a prolonged malaise. I need structure and organization to get shit done. It's why I love calendars and lists. They help me tremendously. The more I pack my days the more I get done. The longer the list, the more I become obsessed crossing stuff off it when I do it. Conversely give me an entire day with nothing to do except one 15-minute errand and it's pretty much a guarantee I won't get to it. I have no answer for this, I just know what I need and what works for me.</p>

        <p>Recently, Paraguay and I sat down to work out "our" routine. It had been long overdue. Since The Bean's arrival we've both been "off" and our schedules have been far too inconsistent. We're going to try and rectify that. The first step was agreeing to what times for what. The next was putting it in writing. In this case we used a shared Google Calendar.</p>

        <p>Pictured is our actual routine calendar (fyi: the big open middle section is the work day). It's literally called that â€“ "Routine". Mind you we have several other calendars as well (My personal calendar, Lili's personal calendar, work calendars, a joint event calendar, an Emma calendar, birthday calendar, etc). The Routine calendar is just for setting up blocks of time to remind us, "Oh hey, right I'm supposed to be doing this now."</p>

        <p>Most of the stuff on the Routine calendar is pretty basic stuff: gym time, walking the dog, breakfast and dinner plans, Emma's bath schedule, and a few more. Though we're making a conscious effort to carve out time for specific events as well. These are the ones we miss most. One specific area is free time for each person. My night "off" is Tuesday. I can do whatever I want. Hers is Wednesday where she can do what she wants. Other things include properly planned "date" night, when to order groceries, when to run errands, even when to read.</p>

        <p>All this must sound a little silly. Though to us it doesn't. Having busy jobs, a young kid, a dog, and decently active social life, we think it's critical to set aside time for things. Also, having a Routine doesn't mean you are a slave to it. Certainly things will come up that will force you to adjust. Though the Routine framework works. At least for us and we think it will help a lot.</p>
