        <h3>404 Error:<br>Learning Code Online</h3>

        <p>Over the last year I've tried a variety of "sites" to learn coding. The list includes <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>, <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/" target="_blank">Shay Howe</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>, <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/" target="_blank">Dive Into HTML5</a>, and <a href="https://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css/" target="_blank">Tuts</a> just to name a few. There are countless more. And yet none of them are great at actually "learning" code.</p>

        <p>I admire them all for trying, I truly do. I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://ryancarson.com/" target="_blank">Ryan Carson</a> and Team Treehouse. As well as the crew at Codecademy. I want these sites to succeed, though I question whether they are really "teaching" people. They have certainly helped folks (including me) get their feet wet and get familiar with the coding landscape, but they all end up being more frustrating than anything else. That's because none of them actually teach. There is no interaction, there is no real usage except for very rigid defined paths that are not intuitive. These sites simply perform the same rote actions and move on assuming you get it. Learning doesn't work that way. It's a give and take. A little here, a little there. Mostly it's real world implementation, often with the oversight of a mentor or hands-on teacher.</p>

        <p>I can draw a parallel trying to learn Spanish (my wife is from South America). I have Rosetta Stone, Yabla, and a few other Spanish apps and books. They are solid resources, and helped me learn the basics and some rudimentary vocabulary, though no actual comprehension. However, after my daughter was born my approach to Spanish changed. My wife only speaks Spanish with her and therefore I am forced to speak it now, too. Only when I began <i>speaking</i> Spanish with my wife guiding and helping me did true comprehension begin. Granted, I've got a lot more to learn, but I'm learning much, much faster as I actually speak Spanish.</p>

        <p>That brings me back to coding. The online sites were helpful at the beginning and then stopped. It was building actual stuff like <a href="http://blog.ex.fm/resource-library" target="_blank">this</a>, <a href="http://today.site44.com/" target="_blank">this </a>and <a href="http://kirklove.net" target="_blank">this blog</a>, along with having an amazing mentor in <a href="http://majman.net/" target="_blank">Marshall Jones</a> Creative Director at exfm and web development stud, that I was able to start putting the pieces into place.</p>

        <p>It's only when we do that we learn. Online classes are nice and it's great they are available. Though they are really just companions or reference material and I wish these sites would advertise themselves as that and not "Learn To Code!" Or even better I wish someone would build a true, affordable, hybrid online/real-life learning experience<a href="#footnote"><span class="super">*</span></a>. So far I haven't found one. Until then, if you want to learn to code, find a mentor and build stuff. It's still the best way.</p>

        <p><i><span class="super">*</span>I've tried a General Assembly class and was underwhelmed. In all fairness, that was a while ago and an intro class. Still, I find the price of <a href="http://generalassemb.ly/education/learn-html-css/" target="_blank">their courses</a> ridiculous.</i></p>
