        <h3>Count On Yourself</h3>

        <p>We all live in our own worlds. Consumed by our own things. The simple truth, as pessimistic as it may sound, is you can only truly count on yourself. That's not to say other people won't support you or help you. They will, and you most definitely need that. But, the important part is no one is going to care about what you care about as much as you. And that's OK. It's empowering in fact, because you're in control.
        </p>

        <p>If you want to get in shape, you have to have to go the gym. Want to learn something? You have to study. Others can't (and won't) do it for you. But, remember, that puts you in control. That's key, because we all fall prey to the classic <span class="italic">expecting</span> others to care as much. It's dangerous for a few reasons. Most notably you set yourself up for being let down. You say to yourself, "How can they NOT care about this!?" It's an easy answer in the end, because they are busy caring about something else. Something you probably don't care about (karma's a bitch).</p>

        <p>If you want to make something happen, then make it happen and don't give a crap about others not caring. Again, that doesn't mean don't take help. By all means take any help you can get along the way.</p>

        <p>You might not have all the tools, you may not be ready, you might be scared, but chip away. Remember you are in the driver's seat, so grab the wheel, pop the clutch, and drive.</p>
