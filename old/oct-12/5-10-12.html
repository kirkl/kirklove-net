    <h3>Carless</h3>

    <p>She was a beautiful Infiniti FX 35 named Stella (you always have to name a motor vehicle<span class="super">*</span>. Always). I loved that car to death. I had been coveting her for years but she was always a bit out of my price range. Even went so far as to hang an Infiniti ad up in my old work cubicle with the caption <span class="italic">"Sum Day"</span> (pun most definitely intended). And one day I finally got her. I still remember the day I went to pick her up, just north of Philly proper. Man was I proud.</p>

    <p>That was over a decade ago now (wow). She was the last car I owned. After her lease expired I moved to New York and just didn't need/couldn't justify having a car here. It remains the ONE thing I miss. Something about owning a car. Especially a nice one. Just makes me feel good. And she really was a beaut. Sexy, dark-metallic-gray with a burnt sienna leather interior. Like being ensconced in a moving cigar club. Some days I'll see a FX drive bye and I'll sigh a bit. I can even tell when one is around without seeing it. They have a very distinct exhaust sound. Almost like a motorcycle.</p>

    <p>I think my fondest memory of her is driving to AC from Philly with my buddy Lance. Every Tuesday night (yes every Tuesday) we'd go to play poker at the Borgata. What was supposed to take an hour would clock in at around 45 minutes. Again, she was a great (and fast) car. I miss those drives a lot.</p>

    <p>Now, I have a membership to Zipcar and an account at National Car Rental. It's just not the same. Not even close. But, that's life in the city. At least for now. Still, I'd really like to own a nice car again. I've got my eye on the <a href="http://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/x/x6/2012/showroom/index.html">BMW X6</a>. Sum day... right?</p>
