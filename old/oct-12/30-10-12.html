        <h3>Spared</h3>

        <p>Happy to report we were spared any damage from hurricane Sandy. We never lost power, the windows held, and being 34 floors up were safe from flooding. The Bean even slept through the bulk of it. Our building sustained some minor damage and Central Park is a mess, but again, nothing major. We're very grateful.

        <p>As I <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23sandy" target="_blank">read the reports</a> coming in today of everyone who has been affected there is certainly a part of me that feels guilty we were spared any damage or hardship. I'm not entirely sure why. Of course the bulk of my thoughts are with those people affected up and down the Eastern seaboard. As silly as it sounds if anyone reading this needs anything, don't hesitate to ask.</p>

        <p>The subways are still not running and probably won't be for a awhile. It also seems my office downtown (Lafayette and Kenmare) still has no power, so I'm working from home again today, and possibly for a few more days. We'll see.

        <p>As always this serves as reminder that Mother Nature is one helluva broad. Stay safe everyone.</p>
