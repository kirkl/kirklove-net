    <h3>Progress</h3>

    <p>Things can be daunting when you can't see the end or when there are a million things to tackle and you aren't sure where to start. I'm certainly guilty of that. If something is "too" much I get paralyzed staring at my list. It's a sure fire recipe for getting nothing done! The exact opposite of what I want.</p>

    <p>And that's when the lesson Sister Patrick from Saint Michael's taught me way back in 7th grade. Don't let the stack scare you.</p>

    <p>I remember her showing us a giant pile of books. And then saying what if you had homework in every single one of these? Pretty scary and overwhelming right? We of course all nodded (and desperately hoped she didn't give us homework in all of them). But, then she said, don't let this entire stack of books scare you. They are all pretty tiny actually, but just appear big when bunched together. So break them apart. Take one at a time and finish what you need to do with it. Then grab another (and don't focus on the stack!) and do that one. After, put it with the other one you did. And just keep doing that. Pretty soon the big stack of stuff "to do" will be gone and you'll have a giant pile of stuff you did.</p>

    <p>I love that lesson and yet still forget it all the time.</p>

    <p>So, when something, anything appears overwhelming, break it down into digestible chunks. Keep making progress on it every day. Over time you'll have licked it.</p>
