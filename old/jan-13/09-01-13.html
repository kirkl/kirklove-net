    <h3>I Was Wrong About<br> The iPad Mini</h3>

    <p>I admit it. I was wrong when I said the iPad Mini wasn't for me. I was wrong when I said I couldn't go back to a non-retina display. And I was wrong when I said I would pass on it.</p>

    <br>

    <div class="large-image-container-550">
        <img src="images/mini.jpg" alt="iPad Mini">
    </div>

    <p>Yup. I grabbed one and I'm totally smitten.</p>

    <p>Paraguay and I went to get new iPhones since her old iPhone was a complete broken turd and mine wasn't much better (btw the new iPhone 5 is incredible, especially when jumping from two-year+ old iPhone 4). Anyway, When we were there I used some old Apple gift cards sitting around (thanks mom!) to get the Mini. And I have to say it's awesome.</p>

    <p>It's hard to articulate actually, but it makes our 3rd generation iPad seem like a giant, obscene, behemoth of a device now. You wouldn't think it would be that much of a difference, but it is. It really is. I'm surprised as hell. I find myself grabbing the Mini much more than I ever grabbed the iPad. And when they are sitting next to each other, it's no question which one I prefer â€“ the Mini, hands down, non-retina and all.</p>

    <p>Already I find myself reading a ton more on it with iBooks, the Kindle app, Instapaper, and Readability. It just feels right. Is it perfect? Nope. You notice the non-retina for sure, but after a minute that softness fades and you are immersed. I'd even say it's less strain on the eyes somehow. Also, I'd like it to be a smidgen smaller for easier one-hand operation. Then again, I don't have giant hands so that might just be me.</p>

    <p>I like this puppy so much, I'm seriously contemplating selling my iPad. I just don't see a use for it. Maybe watching videos and HBOGO, or for the kitchen with Panna and other recipe apps. But, I think the Mini will handle that stuff just fine. In fact since I have it "with" me more, it will probably be used in those scenarios more. We'll see. If you're looking for a cheap, slightly used iPad I could be convinced to sell it to you. ;)</p>

    <p>Related: I'll add that I'm amazed how my preference for Apple products skews so "small" now. As this post lays out - I love the Mini. I also love the new iPhone 5, and my computer of choice is our 11" Air. That's one petite setup for sure, yet lacks absolutely no power. I can do anything with it. Amazing.</p>
