    <h3>Live &amp; Love</h3>

    <p>I live in New York (and it's awesome), but I love Philadelphia â€“ I mean the city itself. It's home and always will be to me. There are a lot of reasons. Mostly because I spent the vast bulk of my life in this area, but also because I relate to the people here much more. Philly is a tougher city. It's blue collar. It's hard working. It gets no respect so it has to constantly prove itself. I like that. Give me the underdog any day of the week.</p>

    <p>I also like its historical significance to this country. Old City Philadelphia is just beautiful and a must visit.</p>

    <p>Mostly, I like the places I know and the fact they haven't changed in over forty years. I'm a big fan of consistency. New York is all about turnover (for the most part). New people and places come and go daily it seems (myself added to that mix). Where as in Philly it's "Lifers" or as they would say here, "Lifahsss".</p>

    <p>Philly is just special to me. It ain't the prettiest place in the world, it certainly isn't the greatest city in the world, and for many it leaves much to be desired, but I wouldn't trade it with any other place in the world. I love it.</p>
