    <h3>Don't Fret. You're Not That Important.</h3>

    <p>Sounds crazy, but I know people who "worry" about writing good blog posts. I'm guilty of it from time to time myself. It's ridiculous for me because A) Only about 30 people visit here each day (thank you!) B) It's only going to last 24 hours. C) It's not important who sees it. D) I'm writing this for myself and the daily habit.</p>

    <p>I suppose worry sets in because we want to be validated, appreciated, recognized, and most of all know we aren't alone and that someone, anyone, is "listening".</p>

    <p>It's silly. It's a blog post! That's all. To thwart that silly worry I do two things. First I realize what I'm writing is not that important and neither am I. I'm not belittling myself by saying that, I'm simply putting it into perspective. Second I remind myself that I'm writing this for myself and the daily habit and that's it.</p>

    <p>There is a great side benefit to doing the steps listed above - it frees you. You stop writing for a reaction and simply write what you want. That's powerful. Just remember though, it's still not important. So relax.</p>
