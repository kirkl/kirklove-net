    <h3>Flying Solo</h3>

    <p>Paraguay is in Nicaragua for the week for work. That means I have The Bean myself. I've done it before, but this will be the longest stretch. Granted my parents are coming to visit for two days and we have a nanny when I work.</p>

    <p>Still, some interesting thoughts about flying solo with a 15-month old:</p>

    <ul class="no-color-reg-list">
      <li>It's tiring. Obviously. More so mentally than physically.</li>
      <li>In some ways it's easier. That's because when there are two of you, at times you just assume the other person will handle it and you get lazy. When it's just you, you don't have a choice so you don't hesitate to do whatever needs to be done.</li>
      <li>You can "feel" yourself bonding with them. It's intensified since it's one on one.</li>
      <li>It's remarkable and gratifying knowing you are this "thing's" entire world and they are completely dependent on you.</li>
      <li>Conversely it's incredibly stressful knowing you are this "thing's" entire world and they are completely dependent on you.</li>
      <li>Taking a bath with your kid is a blast. Hell, baths are great! I need to remember to take more.</li>
      <li>Naps are your friend.</li>
      <li>So are walks, toys, food, and pacifiers.</li>
      <li>In my case, since Bean only really understands Spanish, I'm getting to speak it more. I'm probably doing more harm than good in this department. My Spanish is still abysmal.</li>
      <li>It's fun. It really is. I laugh a lot with her. Mostly again, since I have to watch her so much on my own, you pay attention a lot more. And when I do I catch the most wonderful little things from her. Good lesson to remember when I'm always with her and in life.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Somewhat related: God bless single parents (for whatever reason). Really. Wow. I don't know how you do it all the time.</p>
