    <h3>Dom. The Master.</h3>

    <p>This is Dom DeMarco. Dom makes pizza. Sounds pedestrian at first until you come to realize he is a master. A genuine master at his craft. He's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi" target="_blank">Jiro</a> of pizza. They are actually pretty similar. Dom's been tossing pie for nearly 50 years. If you have ever had a pizza thrown by Dom, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, well then sadly you haven't had the best slice of pizza in your life.</p>

    <p>Dom is all about routine. I love that about him. He makes the pies the same way, with the same ingredients, in the same steps, over and over and over again. It's almost automatic. But, the thing is, it's not. Because nothing in life is ever automatic. Constant tweaking is always necessary. He monitors each pie closely. He inspects the crust thickness. He balances the cheese ratios according to the temperature. He spins the pies differently depending on how fast or slow they are cooking. On the surface all of this doesn't look like much, but all of it makes a huge difference. That's what makes him the master. He knows when to fuss and when not to. He knows what ingredients work and doesn't mess with anything else. He's found the balance, still he constantly observes to make sure it's still working. Most of all, he cares. He wants every pizza to be amazing. He's inspiring to watch. I want to be like him in what I do.</p>

    <p>If you've never been to <a href="http://www.difara.com/" target="_blank">Di Fara</a>, go. By all means enjoy the pizza, but take a few mintues to marvel in Dom's mastery as well.</p>
