    <h3>Date Night: Gwynett St.</h3>

    <p>Lili and I have two joint New Year's resolutions. First, make it a point to have "date night" at least once a week. And second, explore the burgeoning Brooklyn restaurant scene. We figure most weeks we can tackle two birds with one stone. Last night we did just that at <a href="http://www.gwynnettst.com/" target="_blank">Gwynett St</a> restaurant in Brooklyn.</p>

    <p>We decided to roll the dice and go with the $85 tasting menu. At times that can be a bad move, especially if you see a few things on the menu you really want, then don't get them on the tasting menu. I'm happy to say, we made the right call. The 8-course tasting menu at Gwynett St. was impressive. We really enjoyed it.</p>

    <p>While Lili isn't a big fan of cellphones and picture taking at the table, last night she relaxed the rules and I snapped some quick shots. Below is what we had, and a brief description, to the best of my memory. (Note: I completely forgot to take shots of two courses - a white bean and tofu soup, and the second dessert).

    <div class="caption-at-top">First was Whiskey bread. Probably my favorite dish believe it or not. More like a biscuit than bread. Delicious.</div>

    <div class="caption-at-top">Next, I can't remember what this app was exactly. A crisp vegetable with a puree and dried prosciutto.</div>

    <div class="caption-at-top">We followed that with blood sausage dumplings. Thought I would hate these. I loved them. Paraguay did, too, but she loves these suckers.</div>

    <div class="caption-at-top">Next were pan-seared snails over risotto, with an herb puree base. This dish was an absolute wow.</div>

    <div class="caption-at-top">Following that was the white bean dish (not pictured) then this, the baked cod with cracked egg, potato puree, roasted potatoes and grilled leeks. Divine and heavy in that good, decadent way.</div>

    <div class="caption-at-top">The last main course was Lamb two ways. The lamb leg portion (the ball) was absolutely amazing. Even though we were pretty full at this point we killed this dish.</div>

    <div class="caption-at-top">This first dessert was completely forgettable. A fruity, smoked, mess. Bummer. The second was a cranberry sorbet with white chocolate (no photo). Not my thing either, but Paraguay liked it a lot.</div>

    <p>All in all a great meal. Really glad we made the trip out to East Williamsburg for this. Definitely worth it and definitely a place I'd like to get back to.</p>
