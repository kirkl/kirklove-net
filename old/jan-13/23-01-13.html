    <h3>Better Off With <br> The Internet?</h3>

    <p>Paraguay and I got to talking the other day while walking through Philly. We asked each other are we better off WITH the Internet? The easy answer is of course dummy. We most definitely are. And I love me some Internets. It's incredible, rich, deep, connecting, and just amazing. Easily one of the greatest thing to happen to civilization.</p>

    <p>Still, the question lingered. But are we BETTER off? And the answer to that question was I'm not sure and even leaned toward no.</p>

    <p>Mind you the irony of me writing this and posting it to the Internet is not lost on me. Still, PY and I were in agreement we were happier before this constantly connected state. Granted happier is a relative term and we often view the past through rose-tinted glasses. Also, maybe we are just older and remember a time before the Internet and how simple everything seemed then. Though digging beyond that, there is definitely something there. Perhaps it's a longing to return to ignorance which can actually be a wonderful thing. Or maybe it's the fact you were very limited before and therefore your mind didn't race the way it tends to now. Some people are wired for that. Heck, some people thrive that way. I know a friend who can't function unless 20 things are being thrown at him. That's not me and that's not PY. I like simple. One thing at time. Easily digestible chunks. It's just how I work. And the dizzying, ping-ponging of the Internet throws me off. Still haven't figured out how to balance it as again I love the Internet and like a junkie I tend to crave a fix from time to time and sometimes I even OD.</p>

    <p>I'll end with an even bigger irony â€“ I'm building a company (slowly) that lives squarely in the maelstrom of the Social Internet. Though it's different. Or at least catered to what I want and need (and I'm fairly certain I'm not alone). Maybe it's crazy, but sometimes to deal with something you have to tackle it head on.</p>

    <p>Anyway, this stuff has been tossing around in my mind. The Internet is great. But, was life better (slower, calmer, peaceful) before it existed? Has the genie been let out of the bottle never to be put back in? I don't really have a good answer.</p>

    <p>Maybe?</p>
