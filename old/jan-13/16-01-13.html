    <h3>Peek Inside My Drawers</h3>

    <p>I'm obsessive compulsive about order. I'll admit that. There could be worse things to be anal about. I just love when things are "in their place". For the longest time I wanted to organize our kitchen drawers. Yeah, even though you don't see anything when they are closed â€“ I knew. I knew there was a hot mess brewing in each one. It bothered the hell out of me.</p>

    <p>More importantly, I could never find the stuff I needed when I needed it. It made cooking a pain and cleaning up and putting away stuff even more unenjoyable than it already is. So, I decided to finally tackle it.</p>

    <p>I researched the <a href="http://www.hafele.com/us/products/drawer-peg-system.asp" target="_blank">Hafele Wooden Peg System</a>. It's superb for sure, but super costly. It's also a lot of "wood" and I wanted a different texture and something more funky. Somehow I stumbled onto <a href="http://www.kmnhome.com/" target="_blank">KMN Home</a> completely by accident. And I am beyond delighted I did. Not only is it 1/10th the price of Hafele, it's way more flexible, drop dead simple to install, and comes in a variety of colors. We went with green since that's Paraguay's favorite color.</p>

    <p>Man, is it awesome! I used to cringe when I open the drawers and stuff slid everywhere and I could never find anything. Now, I smile. I literally smile when my eyes see that burst of green and perfectly organized drawer (remember I'm anal about this stuff).</p>

    <p>If you want a simple, elegant, versatile, and stunning solution to organize drawers (not just kitchen obviously) definitely check out <a href="http://www.kmnhome.com/" target="_blank">KMN Home</a>. We did a dozen drawers for under $300!</p>

    <p>Here's a picture of the supplies as they came then a few pictures of some of the drawers. Befores on the left, Afters on the right:</p>
