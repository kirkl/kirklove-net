    <h3>Reduce</h3>

    <p>A funny thing happens when you reduce things in your life – you don't miss the stuff you never needed and you end up appreciating the things left a lot more.</p>

    <p>That's why in 2013 I'm focusing on one word: Reduce.</p>

    <p>I want to eliminate as much as possible. This applies to both possessions in my life and emotions. As for possessions I have plenty. More than plenty and I certainly don't need anything else. Funny story that illustrates this point – I told Lili I wanted new kitchen supplies. I was tired of the old stuff. But, instead of going out and getting new stuff, I organized and pared down what we already had. It made a world of difference. I realized A) I have too much shit already and B) keeping things to just essentials makes you value them more. Plus, maintaining them doesn't become overwhelming.</p>

    <p>Emotionally I'm letting go of a ton. Mostly resentment and anger. I'm not sure why I was even carrying it. I'll spare you what I was resentful and angry about, but I will tell you how incredibly corrosive it was to my happiness. So, I've decided not to carry that bag any more. I'm putting it down. And the difference in "weight" is incredible. The lightness, warmth, and joy I feel are remarkable.</p>

    <p>I'm sure if I were super rich, I'd actually be pretty miserable. I couldn't help myself, I'd buy shit. I've seen it firsthand knowing quite a few people with money – and boy do they have problems. Mostly stress (and being a slave to their own possessions), but deep down inside they just aren't happy people. That's because the more shit you have, the more shit you have to deal with. No thank you.</p>

    <p>Reduction can do wonders for your soul, try it, you'll see.</p>
