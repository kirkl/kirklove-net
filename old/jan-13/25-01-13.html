    <h3>Contrarian</h3>

    <p>When you see everyone doing the same thing and you feel a pang to do it another way it's terrifying. You question yourself. You think am I crazy? Am I the only one that sees it this way? If so I must be wrong. At the very least I'm an arrogant prick who thinks he knows better.</p>

    <p>But, what if you're none of that. What if you are just relinquishing control to your gut and and your heart and you are letting your mind take a back seat? Don't you owe it to yourself to find out?</p>

    <p>There is a lot of great looking work being done right now on the web by people far more talented than myself. Really, it's impressive to witness. Though somehow it ultimately rings hollow to me. Or at the very least it comes across as a copy of a copy of a copy. And like a copy of a copy of a copy it degenerates with each iteration. Though to be fair, in web parlance I suppose it just all blends together into an indistinguishable blur. Beautiful, yes, but discernible, no.</p>

    <p>Instead I say be different. Be contrarian. Just make sure you are being honest with yourself and it's what you truly feel. If so, you'll be perfectly fine and most likely very correct.</p>
