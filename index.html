            <p>When <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Mailbox App</a> was announced a little while back, I was intrigued, though not really pining for it. Mostly because I've been using <a href="http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/iphone.php" target="_blank">Sparrow</a> and have been really happy with it. Still, I wanted to check out Mailbox. Th UI looked great as well as their novel approach to email management. And while many thought the sign up (and wait) process was cool and inventive, I found it kind of dickish. Alas, now that I've used Mailbox for a few days I can say this, "It's OK".</p>
            <p>For starters it's a mail app, so let's not get carried away. Secondly, it's merely a fresh UI for your existing Gmail account. Third, it forces you to learn new conventions and labeling systems (not a fan of that). Though mostly, it doesn't really give you "command" of your email box, rather it allows you to toss it to places to deal with later. It still has to be dealt with at some point. Granted there are some novel things like setting a specific time to deal with an email or reordering email, but neither are all that critical (to me). I'll also give them props on the UI, it's very well done. And the app runs like butter, so more props there. But, overall it's just OK. Again, maybe I'm biased because of my use of Sparrow. Still, if you want to check it out, click on the logo. Just prepared to have about 900,000 people waiting in front of you at this point.

        <h3>Kirk Love's PeggSite</h3>

        <p>This is my PeggSite. The first one-page-only media board to frame my thoughts, memories, and experiences that matter most to me.</p>

        <p>It also serves as an instant "snapshot" of who I am.</p>

        <p>Soon you'll be able to have your own PeggSite. That's what I'm working on with some very talented people. If you're interested in getting one for yourself or just have questions drop me a line.</p>
