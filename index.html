    <h3>More Or Less</h3>

    <p>Facebook just rolled out Graph Search. Tumblr is focusing on its Dashboard. Path rolled out Search to highlight your life, Twitter is embedding everything now in its timeline and Foursquare is tacking on info to every check in.</p>

    <p>Though is More, More?</p>

    <p>Perhaps I sound like a crotchety old man, but for me it's just too much. Clearly there are a lot of people who do like all this stuff. And each of the services above deserves a ton of credit for building amazing platforms. They just aren't for me. Especially where they are all headed.</p>

    <p>In the end it comes down to whether you want More or Less "data" in your life. For me, I want Less. Far less. Though I don't want to sacrifice meaning or memory to accomplish that. And while I'm absolutely in the minority in this regard, talking with a lot of people I respect I'm delighted to discover I'm not alone.</p>

    <p>I believe the Internet is at a pivotal crossroads right now. If you look at it, it really is in that awkward teenager stage (let's call the Internet as we know it around 17 years old). It's not sure what it wants to be when it grows up.</p>

    <p>Ultimately it will be many things to many people. For me I want it to be warm and human, with a strong focus on Less.</p>
