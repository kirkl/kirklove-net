          <p>Received sad news today. Someone I admire very much is not doing well. He's been sick for some time and unfortunately things have gotten worse not better. He does not have much time left. This is a man so rich, deep, and inspiring the world will feel the loss.</p>

          <p>Still, as sad as I am, I am grateful for the time he spent with me. Things he taught me. Experiences he exposed me to.</p>

          <p>He is the most extraordinarily eccentric man. That always intrigued me most about him. He knows so much about so many varied things. My scattered brain and scattered interests seems to align well with his. Sadly over the recent years we haven't spoken much if at all. Though I think of him and his lovely bride often. Their amazing relationship. Their rituals. Their nicknames for each other. It's reassuring love like that survives and thrives in this world. We need more of it.</p>

          <p>While an inevitability, death still stings and seems to come when we least want. I loathe it for many reasons now, mostly because I've had to bear witness to it far too much in the last decade on the faces of people closest to me. Though when I feel helpless in those moments I remind myself of the love we've shared, the experiences we had, the moments I will cherish and again I return to feeling grateful, not cheated nor helpless.</p>

          <p>I remember in 8th grade reading, "Death Be No Proud" by John Gunther. I didn't get it. I do now. Death does not own us. And we must remain vigilant and determined to enjoy our lives and more importantly grateful for the wonderful people in them and the brief, but miraculous time we get to spend with them.</p>

        <h3>Kirk Love's PeggSite</h3>

        <p>This is my PeggSite. The first one-page-only media board to frame my thoughts, memories, and experiences that matter most to me.</p>

        <p>It also serves as an instant "snapshot" of who I am.</p>

        <p>Soon you'll be able to have your own PeggSite. That's what I'm working on with some very talented people. If you're interested in getting one for yourself or just have questions drop me a line.</p>
